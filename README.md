# Calculator

Project creating a calculator in the browser.

This was definitely the most challenging project I've made so far. Thinking up the logic and implementing it via code was pretty difficult yet rewarding at the end. There were a lot of errors and bugs initially and I even had to rework my initial logic a few times.

Nevertheless I had a lot of fun creating this and learned quite a lot of things in the process. Looking forward to creating more fun projects in the future!

## Things I learned while creating this

- How to implement logic through code
- How to add a theme changer
- How to display real time using Date()
- How to use FontAwesome icons
- How to manipulate strings to get the required value (like removing whitespace, getting the index of an item etc.)
